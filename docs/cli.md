# CLI Usage

GenLoop ships with a simple command line interface. It currently supports a `version` command and a placeholder command for generating character assets.

```bash
python -m genloop_cli version
```

To trigger character generation:

```bash
python -m genloop_cli generate characters
```

Future commands will include full asset generation functionality as described in `design.md`.
